# Admin User Isolation System

## Overview
This system ensures that each admin can only see and manage users that belong to them, preventing admins from accessing other admins' users.

## Key Features

### 1. Database Structure
- Added `admin_id` field to `users` table
- Each user is assigned to an admin when created
- Admins can only see users where `admin_id` matches their own ID

### 2. User Model Relationships
```php
// Get the admin that manages this user
public function admin()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'admin_id');
}

// Get all users managed by this admin
public function managedUsers()
{
    return $this->hasMany(User::class, 'admin_id');
}
```

### 3. AdminController Updates
All admin operations now filter by `admin_id`:
- `dashboard()` - Only shows users belonging to current admin
- `addUser()` - Automatically assigns new users to current admin
- `editUser()` - Only allows editing own users
- `deleteUser()` - Only allows deleting own users
- `getUsers()` - Only returns own users
- `resetUserPassword()` - Only allows resetting passwords for own users

### 4. Middleware Protection
- `AdminUserOwnershipMiddleware` - Prevents access to other admins' users
- Applied to all user management routes (edit, delete, reset password)
- Returns 403 error if admin tries to access another admin's user

### 5. Route Protection
```php
// User management routes with ownership middleware
Route::middleware(['admin.user.ownership'])->group(function () {
    Route::put('users/{id}', [AdminController::class, 'editUser']);
    Route::delete('users/{id}', [AdminController::class, 'deleteUser']);
    Route::post('users/{id}/reset-password', [AdminController::class, 'resetUserPassword']);
});
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Each admin only sees their own users
2. **Access Control**: Prevents cross-admin data access
3. **Audit Trail**: Clear ownership of users
4. **Scalability**: Supports multiple admins without conflicts

## How It Works

1. When an admin creates a user, the `admin_id` is automatically set to the current admin's ID
2. All queries filter by `admin_id = auth()->id()`
3. Middleware checks ownership before allowing operations
4. Admins cannot see, edit, or delete users that don't belong to them

## Testing

To test the isolation:
1. Create two different admin accounts
2. Each admin creates some users
3. Verify that Admin A cannot see Admin B's users
4. Verify that Admin A cannot edit/delete Admin B's users
5. Check that 403 errors are returned for unauthorized access attempts
